Download Data Directly from the SDK
From version 9.5 and higher, the SDK provides these functions for direct download:

getBlob()
getBytes()
getStream()
Using these functions, you can bypass downloading from a URL, and instead return data in your code. This allows for finer-grained access control via Firebase Security Rules.

Note: getStream() is available only for Node.js, and getBlob() is available only for browser-like environments.
